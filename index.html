    <h1>Gun Violence</h1>
    Gun Violence is  something that should come to an end. It begins with us and gun prevention is something that should come to an end.Higher levels of gun violence are also associated with lower home values, credit scores, and homeownership rates. As a result, gun violence hurts a community's housing prices and drives residents to relocate from or avoid moving to affected neighborhoods.
