    <h1>Gun Violence</h1>
    Gun Violence is something that should come to an end. It begins with us and gun prevention is something that
    should come to an end. Higher levels of gun violence are also associated with lower home values, credit scores,
    and homeownership rates. As a result, gun violence hurts a community's housing prices and drives residents to
    relocate from or avoid moving to affected neighborhoods.

        <h2>Say No To Guns</h2>
    Establish a culture of gun safety. Reduce firearm access to youth and individuals who are at risk of harming
    themselves or others. Hold the gun industry accountable and ensure there is adequate oversight over the
    marketing and sales of guns and ammunition. Engage responsible gun dealers and owners in solutions.
